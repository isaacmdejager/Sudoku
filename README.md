# Sudoku

This repository is a Sudoku generator, game, and solver.
The main objective of this project was to create a Sudoku table with minimal randomness. The most typical way to create a table is via brute force. To randomly assign values over and over until you reach a legal board. The same typically goes for Sudoku solvers: keep throwing numbers in until the table is solved.
I wanted to not only create a more reliable, less brute force way of solving Sudoku, but to also use this solver to more clealy generate tables with minimal randomness.

The generator and solver are still in progress.
The UI for the user to play the game is yet to be started. Ideally, there will be multiple difficulties for the user to select from.
