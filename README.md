# Sudoku

This repository is a Sudoku generator, game and solver.
The main objective of this project was to create a Sudoku table with minimal randomness. The most typical way to create and solve a table is with brute force, to randomly assign values over and over until you reach a legal or solved board.

I wanted to not only create a more reliable, less brute force way of solving Sudoku, but to also use this solver to more clealy generate tables with minimal randomness. And ideally, to use this framework to create and solve Sudoku tables of any size (16 x 16, 25 x 25, 100 x 100, etc.)
